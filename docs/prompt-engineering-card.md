# Prompt Engineering Quick Card

Cheat-sheet for AI macros used in LifeTrack lessons.

| Concept | What it means | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `@workspace` | Tells Copilot Chat to consider the whole repo when answering. | *“Review my most recent changes in this repo (@workspace)”* |
| BEFORE / AFTER | Show original vs new code – makes diffs clear. | BEFORE `bg-green-600` → AFTER `bg-emerald-500` |
| Checklist language | Step-by-step bullet list that can be ticked off. | “1) Open page 2) Click Add…” |
| Rollback step | How to undo change if user dislikes it. | “Run `git revert` on commit abc123.” |

Tip: Keep prompts **short, specific, action-oriented**.
